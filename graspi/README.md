## GraSPI: what it is and what it does?

GraSPI is a tool for morphology analysis. The first application was in the field of organic solar cells, where morphology affect the final performance of device. GraSPI helped us to quantify various morphological features. However, GraSPI can be used for any other application, assuming that descriptor used in GraSPI are physically relevant. We decided to share to code

## Small example

See documentaion

## Major features

GraSPI computes the set of descriptors/features that can used for data analytics (e.g., to establish process-structure-property maps). GraSPI is implemented in C++ and uses bash as a scripting tool to encode basic analysis pipelines. GraSPI aims to handle multiple input formats, and tools to convert various formats it to internal data structures.

## Installation instructions

GraSPI requires boost library. To compile go to src file, you find
there Makefile. If you install boost library in location that is not
searchable, you need to explicity provide the path.


Type make all

### Nix Installation

Follow the [Nix installation
guild](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#chap-quick-start) and then run

    $ nix-shell

to drop into a shell with GraSPI requirements available. To add more
Python packages to the environment edit the `nativeBuildInputs` in the
`shell.nix` file.

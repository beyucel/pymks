    "This example demonstrates the use of the homogenization model from pyMKS on a set of fiber-like structures.  These structures are simulated to emulate fiber-reinforced polymer samples.  For a summary of homogenization theory and its use with effective stiffness properties please see the [Effective Siffness example](http://materialsinnovation.github.io/pymks/rst/stress_homogenization_2D.html).  This example will first generate a series of random microstructures with various fiber lengths and volume fraction.  The ability to vary the volume fraction is a new functionality of this example.  Then the generated stuctures will be used to calibrate and test the model based on simulated effective stress values.  Finally we will show that the simulated response compare favorably with those generated by the model.  "

We will define the material properties to be used in the finite element in `elastic_modulus`, `poissons_ratio` and `macro_strain`.  `n_phases` and `grain_size` will determine the physical characteristics of the microstructure.  We are using a high aspect ratio in creating our microstructures to simulate fiber-like structures.  The `volume_fraction` variable will be used to vary the fraction of each phase.  The sum of the volume fractions must be equal to 1.  The `percent_variance` variable introduces some variation in the volume fraction up to the specified percentage."
